    Given I have access to Foreign Exchange rates api                                       # RatesSteps.iHaveAccessToForeignExchangeRatesApi()
    When I pass the "latest" information to the FX api along with base "" and symbols "CAD" # RatesSteps.iPassTheInformationToTheFXApiAlongWithBaseAndSymbols(String,String,String)
    Then I should see the "base" rate as "EUR"                                              # RatesSteps.iShouldSeeTheBaseRateAs(String,String)
